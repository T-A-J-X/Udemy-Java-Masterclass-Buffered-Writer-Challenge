# Udemy-Java-Masterclass-Buffered-Writer-Challenge
In this repository I've implemented JavaIO in an Adventure Game application we made earlier in the Udemy Java Masterclass course for an assignment. 
This application is only an example of using Hashmaps and JavaIO to store and retrieve data, you can't actually play the game here.
When you run the code, you'll see a printout of the saved locations and direction hashmaps.
